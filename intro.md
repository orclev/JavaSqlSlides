## The Problem

- I have a DB.                                              |
- It contains Records.                                      |
- I have a Java application.                                |
- It has Objects.                                           |
- I want my Objects to contain the same data as my Records. |

Fundamentally we can decompose this basic problem into two sub-problems.

1. How do I query the DB to get the data I want. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
2. How do I take the results of that query and convert those Records into Objects. <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
